# Radiomic Analysis in Lung Cancer - Shidiq MD

Welcome to the GitHub Pages repository for the Radiomic Analysis in Lung Cancer project. This project is dedicated to the application of radiomic techniques to improve the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer through advanced image analysis and machine learning.

## About the Project

This project focuses on the application of radiomic analysis to lung cancer images. By extracting and analyzing advanced radiomic features from medical images, we aim to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and predict treatment outcomes for lung cancer patients.

## Project Details

The project involves the following key components:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering lung cancer image data from various sources.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using radiomic techniques to extract meaningful features from the images.
- **Model Training**: Applying machine learning algorithms to classify and predict patient outcomes based on the extracted features.
- **Results Analysis**: Evaluating the performance of the models and analyzing the results to draw clinical implications.

## Results

Our preliminary findings demonstrate the potential of radiomic features in improving the accuracy of lung cancer diagnosis and predicting patient outcomes. Detailed results, including performance metrics and visualizations, are available on the project's main page.
